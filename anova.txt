A one-way between subjects ANOVA was conducted to compare the effect of sugar on memory for words in sugar, a little sugar and no sugar conditions. There was a significant effect of amount of sugar on words remembered at the p<.05 level for the three conditions [F(2, 12) = 4.94, p = 0.027]. Post hoc comparisons using the Tukey HSD test indicated that the mean score for the sugar condition (M = 4.20, SD = 1.30) was significantly different than the no sugar condition (M = 2.20, SD = 0.84). However, the a little sugar condition  (M = 3.60, SD = 0.89) did not significantly differ from the sugar and no sugar conditions. Taken together, these results suggest that high levels of sugar really do have an effect on memory for words. Specifically, our results suggest that when humans consume high levels of sugar, they remember more words. However, it should be noted that sugar level must be high in order to see an effect. Medium sugar levels do not appear to significantly increase word memory.”
